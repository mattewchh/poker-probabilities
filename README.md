# Poker Probability Calculator

This repository includes code for a project I built that calculates the probability of different Poker hands, e.g. Royal flush, Flush, Straight etc through running simulations over a probability theory approach. The **development goal** for this project was to build something that I personally find interesting to improve upon my Python skills as a beginner in Python, and also learn about mathematical techniques to forecast uncertain future events. 

As my skills improve I wish to expand upon this project by simulating real in-game situations and calculate odds, equity and more.
